# Hi there, I'm Saint, a Backend Engineer

I am a Backend Engineer and a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate. I specialise in building robust, scalable fintech systems and scalable APIs across industries using **Python**.

My engineering background drives my approach to software: I prioritise deep understanding over quick fixes, and I believe in building with simplicity, readability, and architectural integrity.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Languages:** Python
* **Frameworks:** FastAPI
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis
* **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose, AWS, WSL/Ubuntu
* **Architecture:** RESTful APIs, Distributed Systems, Microservices

### 🔭 Current Focus & Interests
* **Fintech:** Developing payment integrations, wallet services, and arbitrage systems.
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Building AI agents (A2A protocol) and exploring LLM integrations.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Actively refining my problem-solving skills to write optimised code.
* **Blockchain:** Recently started experimenting with Solana-based tools and crypto launchpads.

### 🚀 Featured Experience
* **HNG Internship:** Gained rigorous hands-on experience in backend development.
* **Team Leadership:** Previously led the API Gateway implementation for a distributed notification system.

### ⚡ Philosophy
I don't just write code that works; I write code that I understand. I avoid over-engineering and prefer leveraging the native strengths of frameworks to create clean, maintainable solutions.

### ⚽ Hobby
I enjoy playing football in real life and also in games, mostly football manager and fc/eFootball. Other than that, I love to express myself through my writing from time to time. I also recently picked up a liking to traveling to different places and would love to try that as soon as I can
